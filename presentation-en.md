This tech talks aim to be practical introduction to them

Assumptions:

# Functions and high-order function

Its a well-defined "behavior" and can be call be other

## High-order function

## Nested functions

### Anonymous functions

### Closures functions

# Integrated HOFs

## Filter

## Sort

## Map
